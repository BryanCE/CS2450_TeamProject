This will become the read me document we submit. There is another readme under the software prototype folder
which can be used for us while coding if needed. 
This readme should describe the use of the product with descriptions of instructions and how to use
and interact with the program.

Once we have decided who will actually write this this part can be deleted or replaced 
with a word document uploaded from your computer.
