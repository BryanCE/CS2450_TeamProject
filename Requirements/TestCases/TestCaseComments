Test Case 1
  instructions:
      00: Take input from keyboard, store in mem20
      01: Take input from keyboard, store in mem21
      02: Take input from keyboard, store in mem22
      03: Output mem20
      04: Put mem20 into accumulator
      05: Subtract mem21 from accumulator
      06: Branch to instruction 08 if accumulator is negative
      07: Branch to 00 (restart)
      08: pause process
      09: stop instruction entry
  
  I put in 32, stored in mem20
  I put in 44, stored in mem21
  I put in 999, stored in mem22
  
  Correctly outputs what is in mem20
  Repeatedly says "Reached default on switch statement"
  Asks for another integer.
  
  
  
Test Case 2
  This was a copy/ paste of the example the professor gave us (also called testcase2) to
  see if it worked correctly. The outputs matched up completely.
