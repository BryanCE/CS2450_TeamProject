Test Case 1
      instructions:
          00: 1020    //Take input from keyboard, store in mem20
          01: 1021    //Take input from keyboard, store in mem21
          02: 1022    //Take input from keyboard, store in mem22
          03: 1120    //Output mem20
          04: 2020    //Put mem20 into accumulator
          05: 3121    //Subtract mem21 from accumulator
          06: 4108    //Branch to instruction 08 if accumulator is negative
          07: 4000    //Branch to 00 (restart)
          08: 4300    //pause process
          09: -99999  //stop instruction entry
  
      I put in 32, stored in mem20
      I put in 44, stored in mem21
      I put in 999, stored in mem22
  
      Correctly outputs what is in mem20
      Repeatedly says "Reached default on switch statement"
      Asks for another integer.
  
  
  
  
Test Case 2
  This was a copy/ paste of the example the professor gave us (also called testcase2) to
  see if it worked correctly. The outputs matched up completely.
