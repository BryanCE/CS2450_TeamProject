Milestone 1 requirements

UNFINISHED ITEMS
  Software Requirements:
    CPU
    Register
    Main Memory (100 word)
    ALU
    Accumulator

    Word Specification:
      BasicML vocabulary defined as follow.

      I/O operation:

      READ = 10 Read a word from the keyboard into a specific location in memory.
      WRITE = 11 Write a word from a specific location in memory to screen.

      Load/store operations:

      LOAD = 20 Load a word from a specific location in memory into the accumulator.
      STORE = 21 Store a word from the accumulator into a specific location in memory.

      Arithmetic operation:

      Add = 30 Add a word from a specific location in memory to the word in the accumulator (leave the result in the accumulator)
      SUBTRACT = 31 Subtract a word from a specific location in memory from the word in the accumulator (leave the result in the accumulator)
      DIVIDE = 32 Divide the word in the accumulator by a word from a specific location in memory (leave the result in the accumulator).
      MULTIPLY = 33 multiply a word from a specific location in memory to the word in the accumulator (leave the result in the accumulator).

      Control operation:

      BRANCH = 40 Branch to a specific location in memory
      BRANCHNEG = 41 Branch to a specific location in memory if the accumulator is negative.
      BRANCHZERO = 42 Branch to a specific location in memory if the accumulator is zero.
      HALT = 43 Pause the program

      The last two digits of a BasicML instruction are the operand â€“ the address of the memory location containing the word to which the operation applies.

  DELIVERABLE ITEMS:
    Meeting Logs
    Backlogs and sprints (Backlog is basically this document, It's a list of tasks to be completed, I'd like help or ideas on how to better orgnize these tasks.)
    Compare SCRUM and another process (I Am researching KANBAN - Bryan)
      3 reasons for and against each model
    Use Case Diagram with 10-15 use cases
    Running Software Prototype
    Test Cases 10-15 which cover ALL Use Cases
    ReadMe Document describing use
  
 FINISHED ITEMS:
 
 NOTES: This is a very base level attempt at breaking down what actually needs to be done. 
 In SCRUM and other AGILE process models we need to break tasks up into small bits.
 These bits can then be placed into 2 or 3 categories: Unfinished, In Progress, and Done.
 Then Each team member is given tasks to work on.
